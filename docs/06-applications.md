# Applications and Use Cases

Why do we need humanoids? Why not just use wheels?
The answer lies in **"Brownfield" Environments**. We have spent thousands of years building a world for bipedal humans (stairs, narrow corridors, door handles at specific heights). Humanoids can slot into these spaces without needing to rebuild the factory or home.

## 1. Manufacturing (The First Frontier)
- **Automotive:** BMW (Figure), Mercedes (Apptronik), and Nio (Unitree) are testing humanoids.
- **Tasks:**
    - "Kitting": Collecting parts for the assembly line.
    - Quality Inspection.
    - Heavy lifting that causes injury to humans.

## 2. Logistics & Warehousing
- **Trailer Unloading:** The "holy grail" of logistics. Inside a truck is chaotic and unstructured.
- **Tote Moving:** Moving bins from conveyor belts to shelves.

## 3. Healthcare & Elderly Care
- **The Demographic Crisis:** Populations in Japan, Europe, and China are aging. There are not enough young people to care for them.
- **Tasks:** Lifting patients (requires great strength and gentleness), fetching water, monitoring safety.

## 4. Hazardous Environments
- **Disaster Response:** Nuclear decommissioning (Fukushima), firefighting, or chemical spills.
- **Space Exploration:** NASA's Valkyrie. Robots can build habitats on Mars before humans arrive.

## 5. General Purpose Service
- **The "Jetson's" Dream:** A robot butler that can do laundry, cook, and clean. This is the hardest application because home environments are extremely unstructured and changing.
