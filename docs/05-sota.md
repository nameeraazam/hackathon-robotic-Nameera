# Current State-of-the-Art (SOTA)

The landscape of humanoid robotics is exploding. Here are the key players defining the field in the mid-2020s.

## The Research Pioneer
### Boston Dynamics (Atlas)
- **Status:** Research / Retired (Hydraulic version), Electric version announced.
- **Claim to Fame:** The absolute gold standard for dynamic mobility. Backflips, parkour, and dance.
- **Tech:** Heavy use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and custom hydraulic actuators.

## The Commercial Contenders
### Tesla (Optimus / Gen 2)
- **Strategy:** "Data at scale." Using video data from millions of Tesla cars to train the robot's vision, and mass manufacturing techniques to lower costs.
- **Design:** Custom actuators and battery packs. Hands designed for human-level dexterity.

### Figure AI (Figure 01 / 02)
- **Partner:** OpenAI.
- **Focus:** End-to-end neural networks for speech and reasoning. demonstrated "Speech-to-Speech" reasoning where the robot explains *why* it handed you an apple.

### Agility Robotics (Digit)
- **Form:** Backward knees (bird-like).
- **Use Case:** Logistics. Moving generic totes in warehouses (e.g., Amazon, GXO).
- **Status:** First humanoid to be commercially deployed for paid work.

### Unitree (H1 / G1)
- **Strategy:** Accessibility.
- **Price:** Aggressively low pricing ($16k for G1) to get robots into the hands of researchers and developers.
- **Capabilities:** Fast running and impressive stability for the price.

### Sanctuary AI (Phoenix)
- **Focus:** Manipulation first. Using teleoperation to gather massive datasets on hand movements to solve the "general purpose labor" problem.
