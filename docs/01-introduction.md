# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI (like language models or recommendation algorithms), Physical AI involves systems that can perceive, reason about, and act upon their environment. This requires a deep integration of hardware (sensors, actuators) and software (perception, control, and learning algorithms). Humanoid robotics is one of the most prominent and challenging subfields of Physical AI.

## Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI is often referred to as **Embodied Intelligence**. The central thesis is that intelligence cannot exist in a vacuum; it requires a body to interact with the world to truly understand it.
- **Digital AI:** Operates on data. Input -> Processing -> Output (Text/Image).
- **Physical AI:** Operates on the world. Sense -> Plan -> Act -> Sense (Loop).

## The Challenge: Moravec's Paradox

One of the defining characteristics of Physical AI is **Moravec's Paradox**, observed by Hans Moravec in the 1980s. It states that:
> "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility."

Reasoning requires high-level computational power but low data bandwidth. Perception and motor skills require massive computational power to process high-bandwidth sensory data in real-time.

## The Convergence of Fields

Physical AI is not just Computer Science; it is the convergence of:
1.  **Robotics & Control Theory:** The physics of movement, stability, and kinematics.
2.  **Computer Vision:** Understanding the visual world.
3.  **Machine Learning:** Learning from data to generalize behaviors.
4.  **Mechanical Engineering:** Designing hardware that can survive the real world.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Why build robots shaped like us?
- **Legacy Infrastructure:** Our world is built for humans (stairs, door handles, tools, vehicle seats). A humanoid form factor allows robots to operate in existing environments without retrofitting.
- **Social Interaction:** Humans find it more natural to interact with agents that share their morphology (gaze direction, body language).
- **Versatility:** A humanoid form is a general-purpose platform capable of locomotion (legs) and manipulation (arms/hands).
